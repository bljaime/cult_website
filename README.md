This is a first version of a minimalist and naive website for an imaginary cult.

In order to simplify the task, [Cloud9](https://c9.io) has been used, in which we have worked with **node.js** and **express** framework to build our server.

## Quick Start

As I didn't upload the *node_modules* folder, which must contain dependencies, If you want to install them just run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```
  Note that ***package.json*** is supposed to update automatically (please, check anyway).
  
Also, a **join_us** database must be created. You can do it through MySQL CLI using:

```bash
$ mysql-ctl cli
```
