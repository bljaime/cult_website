# An imaginary cult's website

This is a first version of a minimalist and naive website for an imaginary cult.

In order to simplify the task, [Cloud9](https://c9.io) has been used, in which I have worked with **node.js** and **express** framework to build the server.

## Quick Start

As I didn't upload the *node_modules* folder, which must contain dependencies, If you want to install them just run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```
  Note that ***package.json*** is supposed to update automatically (please, check it out anyway).
  
Also, a **join_us** database must be created. You can do it through MySQL CLI using:

```bash
$ mysql-ctl cli
```

## How it works

This is what we visualize when we enter the URL: <p align="center"> <img src="/imgs/screenshot1.PNG"/>
  
Then, we can proceed to enter an email address: <p align="center"> <img src="/imgs/screenshot2.PNG"/>
  
And, once we press *Join Now*, the count of members who have joined the cult increases unitarily in an interactive way: <p align="center"> <img src="/imgs/screenshot3.PNG"/>
